## Hi, I'm Alex. Iâ€™m a software developer, writer, and hand crafter from the UK. ðŸ‘‹

* I build systems for digital preservation
* I do a lot of personal automation in Python
* I [write articles](https://alexwlchan.net/) about programming and other topics

### Interesting GitHub projects

Digital preservation:

*   I was employed by [Wellcome Collection](https://wellcomecollection.org) from 2017â€“2023.
    I worked on a number of digital preservation projects, most notably a new [**cloud-based preservation storage service**](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/storage-service) for holding Wellcome's digital collections.
*   I currently work at the [Flickr Foundation](https://www.flickr.org), where I built [**Flickypedia**](https://github.com/Flickr-Foundation/flickypedia), a tool for copying freely-licensed photos from Flickr to Wikimedia Commons.
*   I have a number of tools for doing digital preservation in my personal life, including [**taking scheduled screenshots**](https://github.com/alexwlchan/scheduled-screenshots) of my website and [**creating Safari webarchive files**](https://github.com/alexwlchan/safari-webarchiver) on the command line.

Personal automation:

*   scripts
*   snippets
*   Alfred config
